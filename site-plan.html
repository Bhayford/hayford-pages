        [FAMILY]
        [The Brandford Hayford family believes highly in unity and love and would everything it takes to make sure that the family unit stays together in love and will forever stay united. For years the family has faced challenges yet still they have fought through every rough time together and all was made possible because each family member believed in each other, and also supported themselves one way or the other. Our family has brought us some of our greatest joys in our efforts to make a family a unit that believes Jesus Christ and making a place that is filled with love, because the best of times won't last forever but as we push on and endure as a unit, the family would excel and pride would be eleminated]

      <h3>[ROOTS AND CULTURE]</h3>
      <p>
        [The family originates from the central part of Ghana and come from the Fante tribe. The Fante live around Cape Coast and Elmina and are one of the Akan peoples. The Fanei speak a Twi language, which is part of the Kwa group, and number about 1,170,000. Inheritance and succession to public office are determined mostly by matrilineal descent. According to their oral traditions, the Fanti arrived in their present habitat from the north by the 17th cent. They served as middlemen in the commerce between the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast. In the early 18th cent. the Fanti formed a confederation, primarily as a means of protection against Ashanti incursions from the interior. Several Fanti-Ashanti wars followed. The Fanti were aided by the British, who, however, destroyed the strong Fanti confederation established between 1868 and 1872, believing it a threat to their hegemony on the coast. In 1874 a joint Fanti-British army defeated the Ashanti, and in the same year the Fanti became part of the British Gold Coast colony.Fante's are known for being middlemen in the commerce etween the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast. The Fante became a very wealthy and prosperous state upon thier dealings with thier dealings with the various European powers.]

      <h3>[FAMILY TREE]</h3>
      <p>
        [The image below shows a family tree for four(4) generations. A family tree is a wonderful starting point to develop a curriculum built around children's identities, their relationships with family and community and the interests, skills and knowledge they have as a result of those relationships. A family tree can be a source of great pride, joy, and can bring an irreplaceable sense of belonging for a lot of people. Family trees keep family traditions alive, tell the stories of past relatives, and are incredibly valuable stores of knowledge Tracing family roots back through generations can help a person connect more deeply with a sense of self by learning about their family's pastâ€”where they came from, who they were, what they did, the trials they overcame, the accomplishments they achieved, the dreams they had.]
