<p>The family originates from the central part of Ghana and come from the Fante tribe. The Fante live around Cape Coast and Elmina and are one of the Akan peoples. The Fanei speak a Twi language, which is part of the Kwa group, and number about 1,170,000. Inheritance and succession to public office are determined mostly by matrilineal descent. According to their oral traditions, the Fanti arrived in their present habitat from the north by the 17th cent. They served as middlemen in the commerce between the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast. In the early 18th cent. the Fanti formed a confederation, primarily as a means of protection against Ashanti incursions from the interior. Several Fanti-Ashanti wars followed. The Fanti were aided by the British, who, however, destroyed the strong Fanti confederation established between 1868 and 1872, believing it a threat to their hegemony on the coast. In 1874 a joint Fanti-British army defeated the Ashanti, and in the same year the Fanti became part of the British Gold Coast colony.Fante's are known for being middlemen in the commerce etween the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast. The Fante became a very wealthy and prosperous state upon thier dealings with thier dealings with the various European powers.</p>
