<h4>FAMILY OF BRANDFORD HAYFORD</h4>
<p>The Brandford Hayford family believes highly in unity and love and would everything it takes to make sure that the family unit stays together in love and will forever stay united. For years the family has faced challenges yet still they have fought through every rough time together and all was made possible because each family member believed in each other, and also supported themselves one way or the other. Our family has brought us some of our greatest joys in our efforts to make a family a unit that believes Jesus Christ and making a place that is filled with love, because the best of times won't last forever but as we push on and endure as a unit, the family would excel and pride would be eleminated</p>

<p>Just like in the image above every single person in the family holds up the image of the family and this means that when a single person in the family is down we are all down, that is why all Brandford Hayford's stand together to hold up the family image even to honor and respect the name of the family</p>
